A real-time software architecture simulation tool
</p>

## 🚀 About

When designing software architectures, I often find myself analyzing "what-if" scenarios. While tools like Terraform offer execution plans, they can be expensive and require additional effort just to simulate potential outcomes.

Archium is a **real-time simulation tool** for software architectures, driven by mathematical models instead of real execution. It allows you to explore how an architecture responds to changes before making actual infrastructure modifications.

### Key Features
🔹 **Instant Insights**: Running a diagram immediately provides:
- Estimated monthly cost per service
- Total monthly requests and workload distribution
- Database size and row count estimations

🔹 **Real-Time Interactions**:
- Service shutdown simulation: See how the system behaves when turning off a service
- Live configuration changes: Adjust service properties on the fly and analyze their impact
- What-if scenarios: Modify resources, latency, failure rates, and other parameters to observe their effects dynamically
