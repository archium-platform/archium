_A real-time software architecture simulation tool_

## 🚀 About

When designing software architectures, I often find myself doing a lot of **mental work** for "what-if" scenarios. While tools like Terraform offer execution plans, they can be expensive and require additional effort just to simulate some outcomes.

**Archium** is a **real-time, mathematical model-driven simulation tool** for software architectures. Instead of executing real requests, it estimates service behavior based on provided parameters, such as:

- **Cost per service**
- **Database size and row count**
- **Expected latency and failure rates**
- **Load balancer performance**
- **Real-time throughput and availability**

By running a simulated architecture, **Archium generates reports and insights** into system performance **without requiring actual infrastructure changes**.
